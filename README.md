# DayLog

Keep track of what you're doing when you do it and forget trying to write summaries at EOD. DayLog[^1] is a dead-simple tool for terminal enthusiasts for taking quick notes throughout your day. It helps you quickly edit date-stamped markdown files where you can take notes about what you're doing, leave note in tomorrow's log for your future self

## Usage

To write or edit today's file, run `daylog` and today's log will be opened in `$EDITOR`.

To view today's file, run `daylog show`.

To interact with a past or future log supply a date (`daylog show -- 2023/01/07`), or a more casual realtive reference, "tomorrow", "yesterday", "1 day ago", etc.

### Log storage

Logs are stored in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/daylog`.
