# DayLog[^1]

Keep track of what you're doing when you do it and forget trying to write summaries at EOD. DayLog is a dead-simple tool for terminal enthusiasts for taking quick notes throughout your day.

## Usage

To write or edit today's file, run `daylog` and today's log will be opened in `$EDITOR`.

To view today's file, run `daylog show`.

Supply a date to interact with an ealier log, `daylog show -- 2023/01/07`. You can be more casual as well and use dates like "tomorrow", "yesterday", "1 day ago", etc.
